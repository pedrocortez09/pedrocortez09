## Data Science Projects

### Sales Predict - Rossmann Store
<li>
<strong>Business Problem</strong>
: The CEO of a drugstore chain wants to renovate its stores and needs to know how much money to invest. To do this, he wants a 6-week sales forecast for each of his stores.
<li>
<strong>Solution</strong>
: Develop Machine Learning algorithm to predict how much each store will sell in the next six weeks. The model will be deployed in production and will be integrated with an API to be resquested by Telegram. So the CEO can request the prediction on his smartphone.
<li>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
: The model generates a dataframe with the prediction of each store and the respectives worst and best scenarios. The CFO now can decide the budget available to renovate the stores, with 90% accuracy.

### Health Insurance Cross Sell - Propensity Score Rank
<li>
<strong>Business Problem</strong>
: The business team need to call their clientes to sell their new product, but cannot call to everyone in the list.
<li>
<strong>Solution</strong>
: Using Machine Learning model get propensity score of each client (Learn to rank). The user has an Google Sheets with API to sort new contact list based on their propensity to buy.
<li>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
:  Calling 20.000 of the test base, the company would reach 80% of the interested. The costs to reach those 80% of interested would be decreased 67% relative to random call.
