## Data Science Projects
 
 
### Curry Company - Online Panel Dashboards
<li>
<strong>Business Problem</strong>
: Curry Company created an application that connects restaurants, delivery people and people. Through the application it is possible to order food at any registered restaurant and receive it in the comfort of your home by one of our registered deliveryman. With so many requests being made, the database grew and my goal was to create dashboards for viewing the main business metrics through a web page where the CEO could easily interact and view.
<li>
<strong>Solution</strong>
: Creation of an online panel with interactive dashboards, where the CEO will be able to see growth metrics for the company, partner restaurants and couriers.
<li>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
: The objective of this project is to create graphs and tables that display the metrics in the best possible way to help the CEO of the company. We can conclude that the number of orders increased considerably between weeks 05 and 13 of the year 2022.

### Sales Predict - Rossmann Store
<li>
<strong>Business Problem</strong>
: The CEO of a drugstore chain wants to renovate its stores and needs to know how much money to invest. To do this, he wants a 6-week sales forecast for each of his stores.
<li>
<strong>Solution</strong>
: Develop Machine Learning algorithm to predict how much each store will sell in the next six weeks. The model will be deployed in production and will be integrated with an API to be resquested by Telegram. So the CEO can request the prediction on his smartphone.
<li>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
: The model generates a dataframe with the prediction of each store and the respectives worst and best scenarios. The CFO now can decide the budget available to renovate the stores, with 90% accuracy.

### Health Insurance Cross Sell - Propensity Score Rank
<li>
<strong>Business Problem</strong>
: The business team need to call their clientes to sell their new product, but cannot call to everyone in the list.
<li>
<strong>Solution</strong>
: Using Machine Learning model get propensity score of each client (Learn to rank). The user has an Google Sheets with API to sort new contact list based on their propensity to buy.
<li>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
:  Calling 20.000 of the test base, the company would reach 80% of the interested. The costs to reach those 80% of interested would be decreased 67% relative to random call.

 ### Insiders Cluster
<li>
<strong>Business Problem</strong>
:  An Ecommerce called All in One Place sell second-line products from various brands at a lower price. After a year of operation, the marketing team wants to release the "Insiders Program". The program consists in segment customers based on their similarities (looking into recency, frequency and gross revenue).
<li>
<strong>Solution</strong>
: With customer transaction data, it was possible to create new features in order to group customers based on their similarities. For this, Machine Learning algorithms such as KNN, GMM and HC were used. In addition to embedding techniques for forming the clusters.
<li>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
: With the clusters formed, it was possible to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each one of them, in order to create personalized marketing strategies.

  ### Cardio Catch Disease
<li>
<strong>Business Problem</strong>
:  Cardio Catch Diseases is a company specialized in detecting heart disease in the early stages. Its business model lies in offering an early diagnosis of cardiovascular disease for a certain price. Currently, the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease is manually made by a team of specialists. The current accuracy of the diagnosis varies between 55% and 65%. The price of the diagnosis, paid by the client, varies according to the precision achieved by the team of specialists. That make the company either have a profitable operation, revenue greater than the cost, or an operation with a loss, revenue less than the cost. This instability of the diagnosis makes the company to have an unpredictable cashflow.
<li>
<strong>Solution</strong>
: With data from old patients it was possible to use a Machine Learning model to detect heart problems in new patients. Having a defined exam precision, the company would have a fixed value for each exam, and could project the annual billing
<li>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
: The model has an accuracy of 74%, which would mean a profit of $148.4MM in the best case, for a base of 70k customers.
